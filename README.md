# Hangman
I designed a game of hangman to run from terminal. The game will visually show which letters you've correctly guessed, while not letting you repeat guesses. There's a counter for how many guesses you have left that only counts down if you guess an actual letter. All that considered, I haven't made the actual, visual man, but I may add that if I learn tkinter or something akin to that. 
# Please try to break this code. 
I put a lot of effort into ensuring the errors are accounted for. Let me know what you think!

# Do note:
You need to have the words.txt file I've included in the same directory as the .py file for this to function.
